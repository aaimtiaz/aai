      <h2>Hi...!!!</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Ahmad Al-Imtiaz — a prospective Ph.D. student in astrophysics with a passion for exploring the universe through observations. I earned my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Physics
        from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST), Bangladesh, and I am currently working as a lecturer at Daffodil International University (DIU), where I
        teach undergraduate physics courses to engineering students. I am also a research intern with the ICTP PWF Bangladesh Collaboration.
      </p>

      <p>
        My research focuses on the internal structure, chemical composition, and evolution of galaxies using strong gravitational lensing. I have worked with Gemini/GSAOI, HST
        and JWST imaging data, as well as Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopic data, and have modeled lensing systems using Lenstronomy. My recent publication in <em>Astronomy & Astrophysics</em>
        (July 2025) investigates the correlation between the local environment and the internal structure of massive elliptical galaxies. I am also working on the chemical composition
        analysis of the lensed quiescent galaxy AGEL0014, the stellar population study of the Sparkler galaxy, and an investigation into the Hubble constant tension using optical and
        near-infrared observations of Type Ia supernovae.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond academics, I have attended several international workshops and schools in astronomy and astrophysics, which have strengthened my skills as both a researcher
        and an educator. I am passionate about science communication and outreach — particularly inspiring young students in rural areas to explore the wonders of the night sky.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of academics, I love traveling — especially to mountains and green places — and enjoy cycling as a way to both explore and recharge. This website is
        a window into my academic journey, research, teaching, travels, and personal writings. Feel free to explore!
